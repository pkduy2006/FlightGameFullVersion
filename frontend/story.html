                Your country is in a war with another country. You are a combat pilot, and you
always want to destroy the enemy’s infrastructure as much as you can. One day, you
have an ultimate mission: destroy the enemy's main airports.
            </p>
            <p>
                You set off on your journey from your base. You will be provided with a bomber
jet and a limited amount of aviation gasoline. Be careful with it, because you will
absolutely be killed by your enemy if you run out of fuel while completing your mission.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you arrive at the airspace of any airport, you are greeted by a message
from your control display board. After that, you will receive a notification that makes you
choose either to destroy or land at this airport. Both choices have advantages and
disadvantages. So, be careful when making any decisions!
            </p>
            <p>
                When you arrive at your target, you must destroy it. You will receive a huge
bonus after finishing your mission.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, you have the last mission: Come home safely. Although the enemy’s
main airport is destroyed, they are still very strong. As a result, do not relax.
